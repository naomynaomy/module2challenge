##  Loan Qualifer Calculator

This program is a calculator that prompts a user for information to determine whether they qualify for a loan given a list with various bank information. Enhanced usability was added by creating a function to allow a user to save a populated list of qualified loans as a csv file; user also has the ability to opt-out of saving the file.
